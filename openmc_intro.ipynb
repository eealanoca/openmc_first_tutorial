    "# Modeling a Pin-Cell\n",
    "In this module, we'll demonstrate the basic features of the Python API for constructing input files and running OpenMC. In it, we will show how to create a basic reflective pin-cell model that is equivalent to modeling an infinite array of fuel pins. We highly recommend having a copy of the [Python API reference documentation](https://docs.openmc.org/en/stable/pythonapi/index.html) open in another browser tab that you can refer to."

In OpenMC, many objects, including materials, are identified by a \"unique ID\" that is simply just a positive integer. These IDs are used when exporting XML files that the solver reads in. They also appear in the output and can be used for identification. Since an integer ID is not very useful by itself, you can also give a material a `name` as well."

    "## Defining Geometry\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point, we have three materials defined, exported to XML, and ready to be used in our model. To finish our model, we need to define the geometric arrangement of materials. OpenMC represents physical volumes using constructive solid geometry (CSG), also known as combinatorial geometry. The object that allows us to assign a material to a region of space is called a `Cell` (same concept in MCNP, for those familiar). There are four major stages in building a cell:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Surfaces\n",
    "In order to define a region that we can assign to a cell, we must first define surfaces which bound the region. A *surface* is a locus of zeros of a function of Cartesian coordinates $x$, $y$, and $z$, e.g.\n",
    "\n",
    "- A plane perpendicular to the x axis: $x - x_0 = 0$\n",
    "- A cylinder parallel to the z axis: $(x - x_0)^2 + (y - y_0)^2 - R^2 = 0$\n",
    "- A sphere: $(x - x_0)^2 + (y - y_0)^2 + (z - z_0)^2 - R^2 = 0$\n",
    "\n",
    "Between those three classes of surfaces (planes, cylinders, spheres), one can construct a wide variety of models. It is also possible to define cones and general second-order surfaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Half-Spaces\n",
    "Note that defining a surface is not sufficient to specify a volume -- in order to define an actual volume, one must reference the half-space of a surface. A surface *half-space* is the region whose points satisfy a positive or negative inequality of the surface equation. For example, for a sphere of radius one centered at the origin, the surface equation is $f(x,y,z) = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - 1 = 0$. Thus, we say that the negative half-space of the sphere, is defined as the collection of points satisfying $f(x,y,z) < 0$, which one can reason is the inside of the sphere. Conversely, the positive half-space of the sphere would correspond to all points outside of the sphere.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Regions\n",
    "A region is then a combination (or just one) half-space.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cells\n",
    "\n",
    "A Cell ties a region together with a \"fill\" (see below). Cells can be grouped together into `Universes` to produce replicated geometry (discussed in more detail later).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Fills\n",
    "Finally, a cell is complete once we have defined what is _filling_ the cell, which may be one of:\n",
    "\n",
    "- material\n",
    "- nothing (`None`), or vacuum/void\n",
    "- universe\n",

    "We saw before that we could call the `Universe.plot()` method to show a universe while we were creating our geometry. There is also a built-in plotter in the codebase that is much faster than the Python plotter and has more options. The interface looks somewhat similar to the `Universe.plot()` method. Instead though, we create `Plot` instances, assign them to a `Plots` collection, export it to XML, and then run OpenMC in geometry plotting mode. As an example, let's specify that we want the plot to be colored by material (rather than by cell) and we assign yellow to fuel and blue to water."

    "\n",
    "The `openmc.statepoint` object will read information from the `summary.h5` file if one is present, keeping that file open in the Python interpreter. The open `summary.h5` file can interfere with the initialization of subsequent OpenMC simulations. It is recommended that information be extracted from statepoints within a [context manager](https://book.pythontips.com/en/latest/context_managers.html) as we do here. Alternatively, making sure to call the `openmc.StatePoint.close` method will work also. For more details please look to the [relevant section in the user's guide](https://docs.openmc.org/en/stable/usersguide/troubleshoot.html#runtimeerror-failed-to-open-hdf5-file-with-mode-w-summary-h5).   \n",

    "Note that the units of flux in the above plot are in $\\frac{particle-cm}{source-particle}$. As is the case with many values tallied by Monte Carlo codes, the value of the flux does not account for volume and is in terms of the number of source particles emitted. To generate this same plot in terms of absolute flux units ($\\frac{particle}{cm^{2}-s}$) we'll need to normalize this tally by:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - the volume of the region the tally covers\n",
    "  - the number of source particle emitted\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, the volume of the region is the volume of the entire pincell. Because we're working with a 2-D model, we'll get units that give us the flux per unit length of the pincell in the axial direction. For simplicity, we'll assume that our pincell is 1 cm in height to make life easier. OpenMC's geometry object allows for computation of a bounding box for geometries like this that will help make this more straight forward."
